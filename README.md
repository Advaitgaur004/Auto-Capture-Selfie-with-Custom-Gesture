# Auto-Capture-Selfie-with-Custom-Gesture
 "Auto Capture Selfie with Custom Gesture" is a feature that enables users to take selfies using a mobile application without needing to manually press a button. Instead, users can define a custom gesture or pose, and when they perform that gesture in front of their device's camera, the app will automatically capture a selfie
