Introduction

The software specifications for an application that takes selfies automatically when it notices a smile in the camera view. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) object identification algorithm will be used to detect smiles.

1. Model Training:

    Data Acquisition: Gather a dataset of labeled images containing a variety of faces with and without smiles.
    Model Training and Optimization: Train the YOLO model on the dataset to accurately identify smiles.
    Model Evaluation: Test the trained model on a separate validation dataset to assess its accuracy and identify potential biases or limitations.

2. System Overview

The components of the system will be as follows:
    Camera: Record video in real time using the front-facing camera on the device.
    Preprocessing Module:A preprocessing module before the Smile Detection module. This module may handle activities such as image scaling, normalisation, and pre-processing that are 
        particular to the YOLO input needs.
    Smile Detection Module: This module analyses the video feed using the YOLO algorithm to identify smiles.
    Capture Module: After getting approval from the Smile Detection Module, this module starts to capture a selfie.

3. Functional Requirements
    Smile Detection: 
         The YOLO algorithm will be used by the system to continuously and in real-time analyse the camer
         stream.
    
    Selfie Capture:
        The system will take a selfie (picture or video) as soon as it confirms that the confidence level for grin detection 
        has been exceeded.
        The taken selfies must be stored to the device's local storage.
    
    User Interface:
        The user interface shall be intuitive and user-friendly.
        The user shall have access to settings for configuring capture delay, image/video format, and storage location.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
    Performance:
        The system shall achieve real-time smile detection with minimal processing overhead and impact on device performance.
        The capture process shall be efficient and minimize latency between smile detection and image capture.
    Accuracy:
        The YOLO algorithm shall accurately identify smiles with a high success rate and minimal false positives/negatives.
